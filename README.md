Focal Plane QA sandbox

This repo is a sandbox for sharing code and notebooks studying focal plane quality assurance (QA).
The DESI svn server has other complimentary codes which require the DESI online system, while this code is intended to run within the DESI Data Systems environment at NERSC (e.g. to access the ops database mirror and desimodel).

It is not yet organized into a formal structure to be installed, automated, etc.  Maybe pieces will migrate that way, maybe not.
